    <p>Humans are all pretty similar. The set of things that you and I both believe is quite large, and not super useful for me to discuss. In this post I'll keep a list of some topics on which I have a strong and non-widely-held view. I've named the post "mildly hot takes" because lots of my views are only radical in the proper context. For example, an opinion like "humanity is >10% likely to end within 5 years" is widely believed by EA's, but not widely believed outside of the EA community.</p>

    <p>Effective altruism (EA), rationality, trans-humanism, utilitarianism, etc empirically seem to have a pretty bad reputation. The first thing that people will always point to is FTX. People next will state that utilitarianism is too demanding / has incorrect conclusions.</p>

    <p>Note -- this post might come across as cynical or critical or not nice. Sorry, I didn't really mean it that way! Consider reading something lighter like [[cooking]] instead. Also -- remark: is "cooking" the only "non-heavy" blog post I've ever written on skyspace3? lol. good for me I guess.</p>

    <p>I've decided that communicating about [[AI xrisk]] and doing [[MAD Agenda|technical alignment work]] are two of the most important things to spend my time on right now. (The third and final category of things that I think is important to allocate time to atm is having awesome [[talking to people|social]] connections).</p>

    <p>I recently watched the movie "Don't look up". The movie has a couple main messages, all of which are great (although also some boring parts which I recommend 4x speeding). Max Tegmark has a nice Times article about why this movie is similar to the AI situation. I'll say some different stuff here though.</p>

    <div class="date">(December 19, 2024)</div>
    <p>Sometimes I have different expectations for myself vs for other ppl. I'm sure this goes both ways, but I mostly notice myself holding Alek to a higher standard than other people. There is an idiom in Chinese "严以律己宽以待人" -- it means that it's good to hold yourself to a high standard while being forgiving towards others.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I [[mildly hot takes|believe different things]] than other people that I respect. This is pretty concerning because [[wrong exists]], and I don't want to be wrong, so conditional on me being wrong I'd like to know that I am.</p>

    <p>A lot of people have asked me lately "what cool stuff have you been learning in your deep learning class"? I haven't had a very good answer. In this post I plan to discuss some stuff that we've talked about and highlight some things that I have found cool.</p>
