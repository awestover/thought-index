    <p>> Exposing your brain to lots of stimuli can wreck your ability to concentrate and stuff.</p>

    <p>> If you feel that you are doing something misaligned with your values, consider telling an accountability partner about it about committing to change right now.</p>

    <div class="date">(June 28, 2025)</div>
    <p>> Strive not to find a convincing explanation. Strive instead to have true beliefs. It's much better to be confused and *know* that you're confused than believe an incorrect thing.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I believe different things than other people that I respect. This is pretty concerning because [[wrong exists]], and I don't want to be wrong, so conditional on me being wrong I'd like to know that I am.</p>

    <p>Something that I feel pretty strongly about is that technology currently does a lot of harm.</p>

    <p>Often -- especially when I'm contemplating doing unfamiliar or "uncomfortable" things with regards to mitigating xrisk from AI -- I'll have thoughts basically of the following form: "I shouldn't be doing this --- I'm the **wrong person** to be doing this."</p>

    <p>How would you like to die? Well, really [[Will humans beat death in the next 30 years?|I'd rather not]]. Okay, so it's a sore subject. Maybe instead let me ask, **how would you like to live**? This seems like a better question for several reasons. For instance, it seems more actionable. If I am to die, I don't think assigning lots of extra weight to that moment is good. If anything that moment should have the least weight, because I'll never remember it.</p>

    <p>tl;dr: when having a disagreement involving a complex concept X, consider saying what you actually mean by X, or both parties might just be talking past each other!</p>

    <div class="date">(June 28, 2025)</div>
    <p>Effective altruism, rationality, trans-humanism, utilitarianism, etc empirically seem to have a fairly bad reputation among the wider population. If you mention this in a conversation ppl will instantly be like "oh so you should rob a bank, or be SBF", or talk about how cold calculation gets the wrong answers to moral questions. I was previously pretty confused about this, because most of these ideas seem like common-sense to me.</p>

    <p>Often, I'll send person X a message like "hey do you want to do activity Y?". You can imagine situations where you'd like to only give this bid to person X if their answer is yes. In cryptography this is called "ZK-dating" (ok actually I just made this name up).</p>

    <div class="date">(January 05, 2025)</div>
    <p>I recently watched the movie "Don't look up". The movie has a couple main messages, all of which are great (although also some boring parts which I recommend 4x speeding). Max Tegmark has a nice Times article about why this movie is similar to the AI situation. I'll say some different stuff here though.</p>

    <div class="date">(December 19, 2024)</div>
    <p>Sometimes I have different expectations for myself vs for other ppl. I'm sure this goes both ways, but I mostly notice myself holding Alek to a higher standard than other people. There is an idiom in Chinese "严以律己宽以待人" -- it means that it's good to hold yourself to a high standard while being forgiving towards others.</p>

    <p>A lot of people have asked me lately "what cool stuff have you been learning in your deep learning class"? I haven't had a very good answer. In this post I plan to discuss some stuff that we've talked about and highlight some things that I have found cool.</p>
