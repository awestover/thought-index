    <p>Back when I graduated high-school, I made a digital "yearbook" -- a simple web-app that let classmates leave messages for each other. I got some nice notes which are still stored at `~/dropbox/notes/nice-notes.txt`. Note that I don't know why this is called a yearbook but whatever. I really enjoy receiving and writing such notes (specs below), so I am using my graduation from college as an excuse to create yearbookv2 --- a high tech endeavor to facilitate sending and receiving such messages (it will be a google form).</p>

    <p>I'm meeting with an MA senator today. The theory of change is pretty weak, but I've thought about it and I think that the sign is at least positive, so that's good. It also feels like this is a part of my civic duty, or at least it feels nice and virtuous and low effort.</p>

    <div class="date">(April 05, 2025)</div>
    <p>A principle of interacting with people that is highly under-utilized is asking people for help. It's possible to go too far with this, but I suspect you aren't. The easiest way to employ this interacting with people strategy is, when interacting with someone you can think about the set of problems that you're currently dealing with and talk about them with other people. A note of caution is that it's bad to try to put responsibility for any decisions on other people -- this is not [[responsibility|responsible]]. But this is a service that most people are happy to provide and sometimes it'll be useful. In my latest instantiation of trying this I asked some people for some cool math problems, because I wanted to get some exposure to some different topics. This saved me a lot of time trying to find good problems. Thanks!</p>

    <p>Humans are all pretty similar. The set of things that you and I both believe is quite large, and not super useful for me to discuss. In this post I'll keep a list of some topics on which I have a strong and non-widely-held view. I've named the post "mildly hot takes" because lots of my views are only radical in the proper context. For example, an opinion like "humanity is >10% likely to end within 5 years" is widely believed by EA's, but not widely believed outside of the EA community.</p>

    <p>I'm mostly not focusing on school right now -- spending time on research / projects seems more useful and more interesting and also better for learning things.

    <p>Effective altruism (EA), rationality, trans-humanism, utilitarianism, etc empirically seem to have a pretty bad reputation. The first thing that people will always point to is FTX. People next will state that utilitarianism is too demanding / has incorrect conclusions.</p>
