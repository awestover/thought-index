A stylized, abstract scene depicting two cartoon-like figures: one labeled "Generator" radiating bright, colorful, branching pathways and glowing idea orbs, dynamically creating multiple complex puzzle pieces and mathematical symbols; the other labeled "Refuter" holding a magnifying glass, examining and selectively pruning the puzzle pieces with sharp, precise motions, sending flawed pieces into a fading shadow. Between them, a swirling flow of ideas being tested and refined, with glowing lemmas and simple geometric shapes representing clarity emerging from chaos. The background is a soft gradient of deep blues and purples symbolizing deep thought and problem-solving, with subtle glowing nodes connected by lines evoking a network of logical steps. The overall mood is collaborative, iterative, and intellectual. No text or letters in the image.
