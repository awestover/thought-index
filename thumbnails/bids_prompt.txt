A stylized, abstract digital scene showing two cartoon-like figures (Alice and Bob) separated by a semi-transparent encrypted data stream made of glowing, interlocking puzzle pieces and binary code. Surrounding them is a soft network web of multiple overlapping translucent forms and checkboxes representing a generalized questionnaire. The scene conveys privacy, trust, and subtle connection without revealing personal answers. Gentle, warm colors suggest honesty and openness, with a faint clock or hourglass symbolizing time-sensitive interaction. The overall mood is hopeful and thoughtful, blending cryptography and social bonding into a harmonious, modern metaphor. No text or letters in the image.
