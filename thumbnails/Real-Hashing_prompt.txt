A stylized, abstract circular race track divided into equal segments, with dozens of colorful, simplified cartoon-like runners evenly spaced yet clustered in some segments; the runners move at distinct speeds represented by dynamic, swirling speed lines; overlay subtle geometric patterns of modular arithmetic—intersecting circles, grids, and number-theoretic symbols—floating transparently above the track; ambient glowing effects highlight collisions where multiple runners cluster together; the scene conveys a blend of motion, randomness, and structured mathematical harmony, emphasizing concepts of hashing, collisions, and distribution on a circular path.
