Two stylized, cartoon-like figures engaged in conversation, each surrounded by glowing thought bubbles containing distinct abstract symbolsâ€”one bubble showing a heart and chains representing judgment as labeling, the other showing a magnifying glass and arrows symbolizing appraisal and learning; between them, a translucent barrier dissolves into light, illustrating clarity and understanding overcoming confusion; soft, warm colors evoke harmony and insight.
